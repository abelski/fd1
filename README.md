freedive timer (garmin instinct 2 watch app)

This app is designed to enhance the safety and efficiency of freediving training in the pool. To minimize the risk of blackout, divers should spend twice the time of their last dive on the surface. Our app makes this easy by calculating the required surface interval and notifying you when itâ€™s safe to dive again.

In addition to tracking surface intervals, the app displays useful data such as heart rate and the number of laps completed.

Simply press "GPS" to start your dive and "Next" when you finish. The app will alert you when it's time for your next dive. Your session will be automatically saved to your fitness data once you press the back button.
