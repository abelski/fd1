freedive timer (garmin instinct 2 watch app)

there is a simple idea for freediving trainings in poll.
To reduce the chance for blackout diver needs to spend 2x time of the last dive on a surface.
This app simply calculates surface time and notifies the diver when you can dive next time.
also app shows some information like a heartrate and amount of laps.
